# Tweet Sentiment Analysis
This example showcases how to use Hulse to analyse tweet sentiments. We leverage [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to embed our queries into a simple UI, defined in python in our `streamlit_app.py` file.

## Getting Started

After following the instructions presented in the main `README.md` file, install this example's requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, run the streamlit app locally with:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

You should be redirected to your default web browser to visit your newly hosted local app. You can then add your Hulse API key, a tweet url that you wish to analyse, and run a query!
