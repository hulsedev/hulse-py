# hulse-py

Welcome to [Hulse](https://hulse.app)'s Python Client! **Hulse is currently in beta.**

With your team's untapped computing power, Hulse makes self-hosting state-of-the-art open-source AI models easier.
Start reading below to learn how to use the Hulse API, and set up the Hulse desktop app.

## Installation

hulse-py requires an active Hulse API key and a running Hulse cluster to run queries on AI models. Checkout the [Hulse Dashboard](https://hulse-api.herokuapp.com/login) to set these up. hulse-py supports Python 3.7+.

To install hulse-py:
```bash
pip install hulse
```

or from source, using this repository:
```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you've retrieved your API key from the dashboard. Here is a simple example of how to run queries using Hulse, and the [Hugging Face Transformers' pipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers):
```python
import hulse

API_KEY = "<your-api-key>"
task = "text-classification"
# tweet https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1460159146720997377
data = "A reminder: the people in power donâ€™t need conferences, treaties or agreements to start taking real climate action. They can start today. When enough people come together then change will come and we can achieve almost anything. So instead of looking for hope - start creating it."
client = hulse.Hulse(api_key=API_KEY)
client.query(task=task, data=data)
```

Here, we run a query using a `text-classification` model, which returns an estimation of the sentiment of the provided text. The provided data comes from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1460159146720997377) from Greta Thunberg. 

## CLI Host

An alternative to using the macOS app is for you to run a Hulse host directly from your command line. This can be done using the Hulse CLI, and your API key:
```bash
hulse login
hulse host
```
